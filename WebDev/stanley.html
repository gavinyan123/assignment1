            This is Stanley. This is a rare type of human being. He is blessed with the ability to eat while sleeping! Quite extraordinary isn't it?
            He is also a sneaker and streetwear enthusiast; a hype beast as the young'uns would call them. 
            Stanley is known to be a very social creature, however, Stanley, unlike most social creatures can survive without interaction. 
            Quite a versatile creature if you think about it.
