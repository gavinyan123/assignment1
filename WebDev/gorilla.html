            Gorillas are an extraordinary species of primates. They happen to be the largest and most powerful primate and are twenty times stronger than an average human adult.
            Although gorillas are much stronger than humans, they share 98.3% of their genetic code with humans.
            Very much like humans, they communicate with each other through sound and body language. These include barking, strutting, roaring or even hooting. 
            However, very much unlike humans most gorillas live up to forty years and are considered adults at eight years. 
            Gorillas live in groups calls troops or bands, which can have as many as fifty members and are led by a male gorilla called silverback.
