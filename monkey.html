            Many people believe monkeys and primates are the same, however this is false. 
Monkeys are only a subspecies of primates. 
The main difference between monkeys and other primates is that monkeys have tails. 
Monkeys are generally smaller than other primates. 
The largest monkey is a mandril. 
Because monkeys are not as big and terrifying, their habitat is mostly taken over by humans. 
This means that there are many monkeys that are at risk of being endangered.
